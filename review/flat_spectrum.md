## How to say it in math

Written as an operator, the answer table of x³+xy has a completely flat spectrum. A minimum-norm learner fills unseen entries of a flat operator with the opposite answer. And the labels give the gradient almost no pull toward the intermediate that would split the task into easy steps.

### Setting

G = ℤ/p and ψ(x) = e^{2πix/p}.
For a task f and a readout φ: G → ℂ, the task kernel K_φ(a,b) = φ(f(a,b)) is an operator on ℓ²(G). Ω is the training set.
‖·‖_S1 is the nuclear norm and ‖·‖_S2 the Frobenius norm. The effective rank is r_eff = (‖K‖_S1/‖K‖_S2)².

### Lemma 1 (classical)

‖K‖_S1 = min{ ½(‖U‖² + ‖V‖²) : K = UV* }.

Weight decay on a bilinear layer therefore acts as a nuclear-norm penalty.
Training with weight decay then behaves like minimum-nuclear-norm interpolation from Ω.
This is the modeling step. It is exact for a pure factorization; for the real network it is an assumption, supported by the earlier finding that trained blocks are bilinear.

### Proposition 2 (exact)

- a+b: K = ψψᵀ, rank 1, ‖K‖_S1 = p.
- a³+ab: K = D·F, with D = diag ψ(a³) and F = [ψ(ab)], where FF* = pI. So KK* = pI: all singular values equal √p, and ‖K‖_S1 = p^{3/2}.
- For entries of modulus 1, p ≤ ‖K‖_S1 ≤ p^{3/2}. Addition is the minimum and x³+xy the maximum.
- Relabeling the vocabulary permutes rows and columns, so the spectrum doesn't change.

### Theorem A (proven)

Let K be invertible with polar factor W = K(K*K)^{-1/2}. Then K minimizes ‖X‖_S1 over {X = K on Ω} if and only if W = 0 on every unseen entry.

Proof: the nuclear norm is convex and differentiable at an invertible K with gradient W. Feasible directions are the matrices supported off Ω. ∎

For x³+xy, W = K/√p has every entry of modulus p^{-1/2}. So K is never the minimum-norm interpolant, for any proper Ω.

### Corollary (one missing entry, exact)

If one entry of a flat K is missing, the minimum-norm fill is X_ij = −K_ij. That is the opposite phase, which decodes to f + (p±1)/2 and is always wrong. For a+b the fill is +K_ij, which is right.

Proof sketch: write the fill as K_ij(1−s). Then X = √p·W(I − s·W_ij·(W*e_i)e_jᵀ).
This changes a single 2×2 block, whose determinant is 1 − s/p and squared Frobenius norm is 2 − 2s/p + s²/p.
So ‖X‖_S1 = √p[(p−2) + √(4 − 4s/p + s²/p)], minimized at s = 2. A complex s only makes it larger.

Numerical check at p = 97:

- One missing entry: the fill/truth ratio is −1.000000 for x³+xy and +1.000000 for a+b.
- Many missing entries (ADMM): the mean fill/truth ratio is −0.16, −0.78, −0.87 and −0.96 at 50, 90, 95 and 99% seen.
- Decoded accuracy is 0.7% at 50% seen and 0% at 90–95%, below the 1% chance level.
- a+b decodes 100% at every fraction, as completion theory predicts for rank-1 incoherent matrices (Candès–Recht 2009, Gross 2011).

### Theorem B (the intermediate is invisible, proven)

Split the task as v = ab, then f = a³ + v.

Each step is rank 1, but in different bases: χ(ab) = χ(a)χ(b) in multiplicative characters, and ψ(a³+v) = ψ(a³)ψ(v) in additive ones.
These two bases are mutually unbiased: their inner products are Gauss sums of modulus √p.
For r ≠ 0:

    ‖E[ψ_r(ab) | f]‖² = |S_r − 1|²/p² + |p − 1 + conj(S_r)|² / (p²(2p − 1)),   S_r = Σ_x ψ_r(x³)

Proof: on the fiber f = c ≠ 0, a runs once over the nonzero residues and ab = c − a³. The fiber f = 0 also contains the line a = 0.
For p ≡ 1 mod 3, S_r is a sum of two cubic Gauss sums, so |S_r| ≤ 2√p. For p ≡ 2 mod 3, S_r = 0. ∎

So the quantity is at most 4.5/p + O(p^{-3/2}).
By Cauchy–Schwarz, no unit-norm function of the label correlates with ψ_r(ab) by more than O(p^{-1/2}). That caps how hard the loss can pull a hidden unit toward ab.

Numerical check:

- The maximum over r is 0.044 at p = 97 (bound 0.053) and 0.020 at p = 199.
- For comparison, the sampling noise of a half split is 2/p = 0.021 at p = 97, and (a+b)² with v = a+b gives ½.

Multiplicative characters of ab are the same order, by Weil's bound |Σ χ(c − a³)| ≤ 2√p.
The b/a² route is no better. Since 1 + b/a² = f/a³, the only multiplicative characters of 1 + b/a² that the label reveals are the cubic ones. Those equal χ₃(f), whose kernel is itself spread out (effective rank 48 of 97).

### Readout-free version (conjecture, numerical)

E chooses the readout, so the right invariant is the minimum of r_eff(φ∘f) over readouts φ.

- For (a+b)², gradient search finds 2.0.
- For x³+xy, the best readout found is the indicator of answer 0, with r_eff ≈ p/4 + √(p/2): 31.5 at p = 97 and 60.0 at p = 199. The other one-hot readouts give 0.56p–0.67p.
- Heuristic: a rank-r p×p matrix has r(2p−r) parameters, so a fraction ρ of the table pins down at most r ≤ (1−√(1−ρ))p.
- With half the data that is 28.4 at p = 97, just below the best 31.5. At 80% data it rises to 0.55p, and p = 199 did partly generalize there (50.5% val).

### How it fits together (the link to training is a heuristic)

- Weight decay favors minimum-norm solutions. Theorem A says that solution actively prefers wrong answers on unseen pairs, which is the memorization basin.
- Theorem B says gradients have no first-order path to the intermediate that would make the task two rank-1 steps. This is the modular version of the staircase/leap condition (Abbe, Boix-Adserà, Misiakiewicz 2022–23).
- Giving the model that intermediate as an extra target removes exactly this obstruction. b/a² reaches 99.8% and survives after the target is dropped; a+b and random targets give nothing.
- Theorem A depends only on the objective and Theorem B only on the labels. That fits AdamW and ScheduleFree failing the same way.

Proven: Lemma 1, Proposition 2, Theorem A with its corollary, and Theorem B. They are finite-dimensional linear algebra plus Gauss sums, so they could go into Lean when you say so. Nothing is written there. Still open: the readout-free bound, and whether the real network (norms, SiLU) behaves like the factorization model.

## Lean status

Added after the note; the note above is unchanged. All declarations are in
`Transformer.Grokking.FlatSpectrum` (`src/Transformer/Grokking/FlatSpectrum/`) and are
proved without `sorry`. `ψ` is `ZMod.stdAddChar`, `K_φ` is `taskKernel f φ`, and
`addKernel p`, `cubicKernel p` are the kernels of `ψ(a + b)` and `ψ(a³ + a b)`.

Not formalized:

- the numerical checks;
- Lemma 1's modeling step: training with weight decay behaves like minimum-nuclear-norm
  interpolation;
- in Theorem B, that each step is rank 1 in its own character basis, that the two bases are
  mutually unbiased, and the cubic-Gauss-sum route to `|S_r| ≤ 2√p`;
- the Weil-bound remark on multiplicative characters of `a b`, and the `b/a²` remark;
- the readout-free version, which the note calls a conjecture;
- "How it fits together", which the note calls a heuristic.

Scope: Proposition 2, Theorem A and the Corollary are about the complex kernel `ψ(f)`.
Another session reported on 2026-10-28 that the real readouts `cos(2πr f/p)` and
`sin(2πr f/p)` of `f = a³ + a b` have rank `(p + 1)/2` and `(p − 1)/2`, with every nonzero
singular value `√p`. That follows from `conj K = P K`, where `P` is the row flip `a ↦ −a`.
These kernels are singular, so Theorem A does not apply to them. The same session found that
they can be completed, through the symmetry `f(−a, b) = −f(a, b)`, while the indicator of
answer `0` cannot be completed at any data fraction. None of this is formalized. Theorem B
covers real readouts: `φ` is any complex function of the label.
