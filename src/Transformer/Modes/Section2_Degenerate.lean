# The number of modes of a Gaussian KDE — a degenerate mode

§2.1 of arXiv:2412.09080v3, the "i.e." after `eq:Fn`, read in the other
direction.

**What the source says and what is carried here.**

* The source passes from "`t` is an upcrossing of `F_n` at level `0`" to "`t` is
  a mode of `P̂_n`" and back, as if the two were the same set of points.  One
  direction is `upcrossingSet_subset_modeSet` of `Section2_Field.lean` and is
  proved.  The other is **false as a pathwise statement**, and
  `not_forall_modeSet_subset_upcrossingSet` refutes it: for the two-point sample
  `X = (-1, 1)` at bandwidth `β = 1`, `t = 0` is a global maximum of `P̂_2` —
  the sum `e^{-(t+1)²/2} + e^{-(t-1)²/2} = 2e^{-1/2}e^{-t²/2}\cosh t` is
  maximal at `t = 0` because `\cosh t ≤ e^{t²/2}` — while `P̂_2''(0) = 0`, so
  `0` is not an upcrossing of `F_2`.

* What the argument needs, and what it in fact has, is the identity **in
  expectation**: a Gaussian sample almost surely has no degenerate critical
  point.  `expectedUpcrossings_le_expectedModes` is the half that follows from
  the inclusion and is proved; the equality
  `expectedModes_eq_expectedUpcrossings` is stated and unproved.

/-! ### The pathwise identity is false -/

/-- **A mode need not be an upcrossing.**  The source's "i.e." after `eq:Fn`
reads the equivalence `P̂_n'(t) = 0 ∧ P̂_n''(t) < 0 ⟺ t` is a mode as an
identity of sets; it is an inclusion only.  The two-point sample `(-1, 1)` at
`β = 1` has a global maximum at `0` with `P̂_2''(0) = 0`.

/-! ### What holds is the identity in expectation -/

/-- The inclusion integrates: the expected number of upcrossings of `F_n` never
exceeds the expected number of modes of `P̂_n`.

/-- **The identity the proof of `thm:main-result` uses.**  A Gaussian sample
almost surely has no degenerate critical point, so the two counts agree in
