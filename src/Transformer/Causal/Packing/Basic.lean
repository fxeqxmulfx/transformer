# Sphere packing — separated sets of unit vectors, and the volume of a ball

The R'enyi centers of §5 of 2411.04990v2 are, once the indexing is stripped
away, a `δ`-separated set of unit vectors, so their number is the packing
number of `𝕊^{d-1}` at scale `δ`.  This file carries the two predicates that
say so, and the one Mathlib fact the volume estimates of
`Packing.Upper` and `Packing.Lower` run on: a ball of
`EucSpace d` has volume `r^d` times the unit ball's.

/-- A finite `δ`-separated set of unit vectors: the values a R'enyi center
subsequence takes, stripped of the indexing.

R'enyi centers). -/
def SeparatedOnSphere (d : ℕ) (S : Finset (EucSpace d)) (δ : ℝ) : Prop :=
  (∀ x ∈ S, ‖x‖ = 1) ∧ ∀ x ∈ S, ∀ y ∈ S, x ≠ y → δ < ‖x - y‖

/-- `S` is a *maximal* `δ`-separated set of unit vectors: it is `δ`-separated
and nothing can be added to it, which for `δ > 0` is the same as saying that
every unit vector lies within `δ` of a point of `S`.

Source: arXiv:2411.04990v2, §5 — the R'enyi centers of a sequence that visits
the whole sphere are maximal in this sense, which is what makes their number a
lower bound and not only an upper one. -/

multiple of the unit ball's, from `Measure.addHaar_ball`. -/
